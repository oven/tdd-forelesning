<H1>Code Refactoring</H1>

<p>Adapted by Ove Gram Nipen from Terence Parr's <a
        href="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/course/601/lectures/refactoring/refactoring.html">lecture notes</a></p>


<P>Until you've had to live with the same piece of code for a while, you
    will not experience the need for refactoring. This lecture tries to
    summarize what refactoring is, when you need to do it, what patterns
    and tools are available.

<P>These lecture notes paraphrase or quote most content from
    <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672/002-9330989-7896037"><B>
        "Martin Fowler's Refactoring Book"</B></A>. I use keyword "TJP" to indicate
    my own thoughts. There are large sections of just TJP stuff.

<H2>Refactoring?</H2>

<H3>What?</H3>


<P>Fowler says that refactoring is the
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "<i>... process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code
    yet improves its internal structure.</i>"
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Just cleaning up code.

<P>Contrary to idealized development strategy:
<OL>
    <LI>analysis and design
    </LI>
    <LI>code
    </LI>
    <LI>test
    </LI>

</OL>

<P>At first, code is pretty good but as requirements change or new features are added, the code structure tends to
    atrophy. Refactoring is the process of fixing a bad or chaotic design.

<P>Amounts to moving methods around, creating new methods, adding or deleting classes, ...

<P>TJP: Sometimes it means completely redoing the entire code base (i.e., throwing stuff away). Avoid the <em>second
    system effect</em>!

<H3>Why?</H3>


<P>Improve code structure and design
<UL>
    <LI>more maintainable
    </LI>
    <LI>easier to understand
    </LI>
    <LI>easier to modify
    </LI>
    <LI>easier to add new features
    </LI>

</UL>

<P>Cumulative effect can radically improve design rather than normal slide into decay.

<P>Flip-flop code development and refactoring. Only refactor when refactoring--do not add features during refactoring.

<P>TJP: kind of like an immune system that constantly grooms the body looking for offensive and intrusive entities.

<P>Bad code usually takes more code to do the same thing often because of duplication:

<P><img src="code.duplication.gif">

<P>TJP: from Fred Brook's "mythical man-month" remember that conceptual
    integrity is one of his big points. Addition of new features can
    break current system conceptual integrity. Must refactor your concept
    sometimes as well as your code to make it fit properly. For example,
    I integrated page snoopers with search so that I could look for
    keywords regardless of whether the source was local or on some other
    page or other some other site's search engine.

<P>Improving design then often includes removing duplicate code. Don't
    want duplicates because of bloat and also you only want one place to
    change functionality not multiple.

<P>Fowler says he will refactor existing code just to understand it
    better and sometimes it helps to find bugs.

<P>In summary, refactoring helps you develop better code, faster!

<P>Kent Beck:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "<i>Programs have two kinds of value: what they can do for you today and what they can do for you tomorrow.</i>"
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Mostly we are focused on today, but you cannot code today so that you
    cannot code tomorrow. Actively making the future smoother is a great
    idea. When you find tomorrow that today you made a mistake, you use
    refactoring to fix the decision.

<P>Fowler says database refactoring is super hard. See TJP's jGuru example below for entity specifications. :)

<P><B>When not to refactor?</B>
<UL>
    <LI>Sometimes you should throw things out and start again.
    </LI>
    <LI>Sometimes you are too close to a deadline.
    </LI>

</UL>

<H3>When?</H3>


<P>When you can't stand the code anymore or it becomes impossible to add new features or fix bugs.

<P>When your boss isn't looking. ;) There is a lot of pressure not to do work that adds no functionality--shortsighted.

<P>Rule of 3 from Don Roberts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "<i>The first time you do something, you just do it. The second time you do something similar, you wince at the
    duplication, but you do the duplicate thing anyway. The third time you do something similar, you refactor.</i>"
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Refactor when
<OL>
    <LI>you add new features and the code is brittle or hard to understand. Refactoring makes this feature and future
        features easier to build.
    </LI>
    <LI>you fix bugs.
    </LI>
    <LI>during code review.
    </LI>

</OL>

<P>

<H2>What's that smell?</H2>


<P>Refactor when your code smells. It smells in the following situations.

<P> [From Fowler's book, but summarized at JHU, <A HREF="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/oos/lectures/refactoring.html"><B>http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/oos/lectures/refactoring.html</B></A>
    ]
<UL>
    <LI><em>Duplicated Code</em>
        extract out the common bits into theirown method (<B>extract
            method</B>) if code is in same class
        if two classes duplicate code, consider <B>extract class</B> to
        create a new class to hold the shared functionality.
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Long Methods</em>
        <B>extract method</B>!
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Large Class</em> Class trying to do too much often shows up as too many instance variables.
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Long Parameter List</em>
        <B>replace parameter with method</B> (receiver explicitly asks sender
        for data via sender getter method)
        Example: day month, year, hour minute second ==&gt; date
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Divergent Change</em>
        If you have a fixed class that does distinctly different things
        consider separating out the varying code into
        varying classes <B>(extract class)</B> that either subclassor
        are contained by the non-varying class.
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Shotgun Surgery</em>
        The smell: a change in one class repeatedly requires little changes
        in a bunch
        of other classes.
        try to <B>move method</B> and <B>move field</B> to get all the
        bits into one class since they areobviously highly dependent.
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Feature Envy</em>
        Method in one class uses lots of pieces from another class.
        <B>move method</B> to move it to the other class.
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Data Clumps</em>
        Data that's always hanging with each other (e.g. name street zip).
        Extract out a class (<B>extract class</B>) for the data. Will
        help trim argument lists too since name street zip now passed as
        one address object.
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Switch (case) statements</em>
        Use inheritance and polymorphism instead (exampleof this was in
        Fowler Chapter 1; this is one of the more difficult refactorings)
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Lazy Class</em>
        Class doesn't seem to be doing anything. Get rid of it!
        <UL>
            <LI><B>collapse heirarchy</B> if subclasses are nearly vacuous.
                <UL>
                    <LI><B>inline class</B> (stick the class' methods and fields
                        in the class that was using it and get rid of original class).
                    </LI>

                </UL>
            </LI>
        </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Speculative generality</em>
        Class designed to do something in the future but
        never ends up doing it. Thinking too far ahead or you though you needed
        this generality but you didn't.
        like above, <B>collapse hierarchy</B>or <B>inline class</B>
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Message chains</em>
        Say you want to send a message toobject D in class A but you have to go
        through B to get C and C to get D.
        use <B>hide delagate</B> to hide C and D in B, and add a method to
        B that does what A wanted to do with D.
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Inappropriate Intimacy</em>
        Directly getting in and munging with the internals
        of another class.
        To fix this, move methods, inline methods, to consolidate the
        intimate bits.
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Incomplete Library Class</em>
        If method missing from library, and we can't change the library, so
        either:
        o make this method in yourobject (<B>introduce foreign method</B>)
        If there is a lot of stuff you want to change:
        o make yourown extension/subclass (<B>introduce local extension</B>)
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Data Class</em>
        We have already talked about this extensively: in data-centric design,
        there are some data classes which are pretty much
        structs: no interesting methods.
        first don't letother directly get and set fields (make them
        private) and don't have setter for things outsiders shouldn't change
        look who uses the data and how they use it and move someof that
        code to the data class via a combinationof <B>extract
            method</B> and <B>move method</B> (see the Fowler chapter 1
        example for several examplesof this)
    </LI>
    <LI><em>Comments</em>
        Comments in the middleof methods are deodorant. You should really
        refactor so each comment block
        is its own method. Do <B>extract method</B>.
    </LI>

    programmers write code that humans can understand.</i>"

    <LI><A HREF="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/inlineTemp.html"><B>"Inline temp"</B></A> or inline variable
    </LI>

</UL>

<P><em>Renaming</em> is a great idea because code should communicate clearly and
    variable names are super important (imagine a program where everything
    is <TT>v1</TT>, <TT>v2</TT>, ...; that is what obfuscaters do).

<h2>IDEs</h2>

<p>IntelliJ and Eclipse are getting quite good at doing refactorings automatically. They perform static code analysis
    to stop you from altering the program's meaning unintentionally. However, you may sometimes introduce errors if you
    rely blindly on this. <br><img src="intellij.png"/></p>
